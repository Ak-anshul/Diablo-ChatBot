# Diablo-ChatBot

Welcome to the Diablo-ChatBot project! This project aims to create an intelligent conversational agent using DialoGPT, a state-of-the-art pretrained transformer model designed for generating human-like text responses. This repository contains all the necessary code and documentation to get you started with building, running, and fine-tuning your own chatbot.

## Introduction

The Diablo-ChatBot is built using OpenAI's DialoGPT model, fine-tuned from GPT-2 to generate conversational responses. This chatbot can be used for various purposes, such as customer support, virtual assistance, and entertainment. The project demonstrates how to integrate DialoGPT with a simple user interface and provides guidelines for further customization and fine-tuning.

## Fine-Tuning for Specific Purposes

1. **Prepare your dataset:**
   - Collect and preprocess conversation data relevant to your specific purpose.
   - Format the data in a compatible format (e.g., JSON, CSV).

2. **Fine-tune the model:**
  
3. **Load the fine-tuned model:**
   Modify the code to load your fine-tuned model instead of the pretrained DialoGPT model:

4. **Test and evaluate:**
   - Test the chatbot with domain-specific queries.
   - Evaluate the performance and make adjustments as necessary.
